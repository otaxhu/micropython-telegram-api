# Connecting to Telegram Bots API
In this repository I'm connecting to Telegram Bots API from a ESP-32 microcontroller using MicroPython / Python as programming language.

If you wanna get this project up, you gonna have to clone it and create the file `config.py` where you gonna put all of the credentials specified in `config.py.example`, the name is pretty obvious that it is just a example.

I hope you find it useful, peace :)
